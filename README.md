Certainly! Here's a basic example of code that illustrates a simple contract using Python:

```python



contract = {

    "party1": "John Doe",

    "party2": "Jane Smith",

    "effective_date": "2023-05-25",

    "terms": [

        "Party 1 agrees to provide consulting services to Party 2.",

        "Party 2 agrees to compensate Party 1 with a monthly fee of $1000.",

        "The contract will be in effect for one year, starting from the effective date."

    ],

    "signatures": {

        "party1": False,

        "party2": False

    }

}

def display_contract(contract):

    print("CONTRACT")

    print("--------")

    print("Party 1: {}".format(contract["party1"]))

    print("Party 2: {}".format(contract["party2"]))

    print("Effective Date: {}".format(contract["effective_date"]))

    print("Terms:")

    for term in contract["terms"]:

        print("- {}".format(term))

    print("Signatures:")

    print("- Party 1: {}".format("Signed" if contract["signatures"]["party1"] else "Not Signed"))

    print("- Party 2: {}".format("Signed" if contract["signatures"]["party2"] else "Not Signed"))

def sign_contract(contract, party):

    if party in contract["signatures"]:

        contract["signatures"][party] = True

        print("{} has signed the contract.".format(party))

    else:

        print("{} is not a party to the contract.".format(party))

# Display the initial contract

display_contract(contract)

# Sign the contract

sign_contract(contract, "John Doe")

sign_contract(contract, "Jane Smith")

# Display the updated contract

display_contract(contract)

```

In this example, we define a dictionary called `contract` that represents the contract details. The contract includes information about the parties involved, the effective date, the terms of the contract, and the signatures of the parties.

The `display_contract` function is used to print the contract details in a readable format.

The `sign_contract` function is used to update the signatures of the parties. It takes the contract and the `party` as inputs and updates the corresponding signature to `True`.

After defining the functions, we first display the initial contract using display_contract. Then we simulate the signing of the contract by calling `sign_contract` for each party. Finally, we display the updat meed contract to verify the signatures.

Note that this is a simplified example to illustrate the basic structure. In a real-world scenario, contracts are typically more complex and would require a more sophisticated approach to handle their creation, storage, and execution.
